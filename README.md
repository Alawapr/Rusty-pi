# Rusty-pi

This is just a fun program for me to learn rust. It's not focused on speed, just on functionality.

This is the times I got with my current set-up:

500 digits - 2.0 secs

1000 digits - 4.6 secs

2000 digits - 11.4 secs

3000 digits - 28.8 secs

4000 digits - 61.7 secs

6969 digits - 275.8 secs

10000 digits - 783.24 secs

**A LOT OF THIS CODE IS NOT MINE AND I DON'T CLAIM IT TO BE MINE.**
