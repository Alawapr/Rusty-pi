# Rusty-pi

This is just a fun program for me to learn rust. It's not focused on speed, just on functionality.

This is the times I got with my current set-up:

500 digits - 2.0 secs\n
1000 digits - 4.6 secs\n
2000 digits - 11.4 secs\n
3000 digits - 28.8 secs\n
4000 digits - 61.7 secs\n
6969 digits - 275.8 secs\n
10000 digits - 783.24 secs\n

**A LOT OF THIS CODE IS NOT MINE AND I DON'T CLAIM IT TO BE MINE.**
